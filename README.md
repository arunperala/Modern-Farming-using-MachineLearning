# Modern Farming Using Machine LearningðŸŒ±
Farming is one of the major sectors that influences a countryâ€™s economic growth. Farming is the backbone of our nation. This Project helps the farmers to increase their yield by taking NPK(Nitrogen, Phosphorus, and Potassium) values of soil and predicting Crop recommendation, Fertilizer recommendation, and Plant disease prediction respectively. 

- Crop Recommendation system - > By entering the corresponding nutrient values of your soil, state, and city. The NPK (Nitrogen, Phosphorous, and Pottasium) values to be entered should be the ratio between them. Refer to [this website](https://www.gardeningknowhow.com/garden-how-to/soil-fertilizers/fertilizer-numbers-npk.htm) for more information.

   Note: When you enter the city name, make sure to enter mostly common city names. Remote cities/towns may not be available in the [Weather API](https://openweathermap.org/) from where humidity and temperature data is fetched.

- Fertilizer suggestion system - > Enter the nutrient contents of your soil and the crop you want to grow. The algorithm will tell which nutrient the soil has an excess of or lacks. Accordingly, it will give suggestions for buying fertilizers.

- Disease Detection System - > Upload an image of the leaf of your plant. The algorithm will tell the crop type and whether it is diseased or healthy. If it is diseased, it will tell you the cause of the disease and suggest how to prevent/cure the disease accordingly.
  
## DEMO

- ### Crop recommendation system
  ![demo](https://media.giphy.com/media/90JbjdAa5nDq3TJh5u/giphy.gif)

     In the crop recommendation system, the user can provide the soil data from their side and the application will predict which crop should the user grow.
    
- ### Fertilizer suggestion system
   ![demo](https://media.giphy.com/media/FLftUXMFo8N2bBjAXq/giphy.gif)

     In the fertilizer suggestion system, the user can input the soil data and the type of crop they are growing, and the application will predict what the soil lacks or has an excess of and will recommend improvements. 


- ### Disease Detection system

    The last application, which is the plant disease prediction application, the user can input an image of a diseased plant leaf, and the application will predict what disease it is and will also give a little background about the disease and suggestions to cure it.

## DATA SOURCE
The accuracy of the machine learning models depends on the quality and diversity of the data used for training. The Modern Farming system collects data from the following datasets taken from Kaggle
- [Crop recommendation dataset ](https://www.kaggle.com/atharvaingle/crop-recommendation-dataset) 
- [Fertilizer suggestion dataset](https://github.com/Gladiator07/Harvestify/blob/master/Data-processed/fertilizer.csv) 
- [Disease detection dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/vipoooool/new-plant-diseases-dataset)
