# Modern Farming Using Machine LearningðŸŒ³
Farming is one of the major sectors that influences a countryâ€™s economic growth. Farming is the backbone of our nation ðŸ’ª. This Project is a Modern way of Farming that helps Farmers to increase their yield by taking NPK(Nitrogen, Phosphorus, and Potassium) values of soil and predicting Crop recommendation, Fertilizer recommendation, and Plant disease prediction respectively. 

- ### Crop recommendation system

     In the crop recommendation system, the user can provide the soil data from their side and the application will predict which crop should the user grow.
    
- ### Fertilizer suggestion system

     In the fertilizer suggestion system, the user can input the soil data and the type of crop they are growing, and the application will predict what the soil lacks or has an excess of and will recommend improvements. 


- ### Disease Detection system

    The last application, which is the plant disease prediction application, the user can input an image of a diseased plant leaf, and the application will predict what disease it is and will also give a little background about the disease and suggestions to cure it.

## DATA SOURCE
The accuracy of the machine learning models depends on the quality and diversity of the data used for training. The Modern Farming system collects data from the following datasets taken from Kaggle
- [Crop recommendation dataset ](https://www.kaggle.com/atharvaingle/crop-recommendation-dataset) 
- [Fertilizer suggestion dataset](https://github.com/Gladiator07/Harvestify/blob/master/Data-processed/fertilizer.csv) 
- [Disease detection dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/vipoooool/new-plant-diseases-dataset)
