# Modern Farming Using Machine LearningðŸŒ±
Farming is one of the major sectors that influences a countryâ€™s economic growth. Farming is the backbone of our nation. This Project helps the farmers to increase their yield by taking NPK(Nitrogen, Phosphorus, and Potassium) values of soil and predicting Crop recommendation, Fertilizer recommendation, and Plant disease prediction respectively. 

- Crop Recommendation system - > By entering the corresponding nutrient values of your soil, state, and city. The NPK (Nitrogen, Phosphorous, and Pottasium) values to be entered should be the ratio between them. Refer to [this website](https://www.gardeningknowhow.com/garden-how-to/soil-fertilizers/fertilizer-numbers-npk.htm) for more information.

   Note: When you enter the city name, make sure to enter mostly common city names. Remote cities/towns may not be available in the [Weather API](https://openweathermap.org/) from where humidity and temperature data is fetched.

- Fertilizer suggestion system - > Enter the nutrient contents of your soil and the crop you want to grow. The algorithm will tell which nutrient the soil has an excess of or lacks. Accordingly, it will give suggestions for buying fertilizers.

- Disease Detection System - > Upload an image of the leaf of your plant. The algorithm will tell the crop type and whether it is diseased or healthy. If it is diseased, it will tell you the cause of the disease and suggest how to prevent/cure the disease accordingly.
  
## DEMO

- ### Crop recommendation system
  ![demo](https://media.giphy.com/media/90JbjdAa5nDq3TJh5u/giphy.gif)

     In the crop recommendation system, the user can provide the soil data from their side and the application will predict which crop should the user grow.
    
- ### Fertilizer suggestion system
   ![demo](https://media.giphy.com/media/FLftUXMFo8N2bBjAXq/giphy.gif)

     In the fertilizer suggestion system, the user can input the soil data and the type of crop they are growing, and the application will predict what the soil lacks or has an excess of and will recommend improvements. 


- ### Disease Detection system

    The last application, which is the plant disease prediction application, the user can input an image of a diseased plant leaf, and the application will predict what disease it is and will also give a little background about the disease and suggestions to cure it.

## DATA SOURCE
The accuracy of the machine learning models depends on the quality and diversity of the data used for training. The Modern Farming system collects data from the following datasets taken from Kaggle
- [Crop recommendation dataset ](https://www.kaggle.com/atharvaingle/crop-recommendation-dataset) 
- [Fertilizer suggestion dataset](https://github.com/Gladiator07/Harvestify/blob/master/Data-processed/fertilizer.csv) (customized)
- [Disease detection dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/vipoooool/new-plant-diseases-dataset)

## ADVANTAGES 
Modern Farming using Machine Learning offers numerous advantages that can significantly impact agriculture and farming practices. Some of the key advantages are listed below:

 **1. Increased Crop Yield**: By leveraging historical data, weather patterns, and soil characteristics, the machine learning models can predict the best crops to grow in a specific location and season.
 
 **2. Optimal Resource Utilization**: The system recommends the appropriate types and quantities of fertilizers based on soil nutrient analysis and crop selection. This ensures that resources like fertilizers are used efficiently, minimizing waste and environmental impact.
 
**3. Data-Driven Decision Making**: The project relies on data analysis and machine learning models, enabling farmers to make informed decisions. This reduces uncertainty and reliance on traditional methods, leading to more efficient and effective farming practices.

**4. Cost Reduction**: Improved crop yield, and reduced resource usage. This allows for better financial management and increased profitability in farming.

**5. Timely Disease Detection**: Early detection of diseases and pests is crucial for preventing large-scale crop damage. The disease detection model, trained on images of healthy and diseased crops, can identify potential issues early, enabling timely intervention and reducing losses.

**6. Continuous Improvement**: The machine learning models used in the project can be continuously updated and improved with more data. As more information becomes available, the models' accuracy and performance can increase, leading to even better results over time.
